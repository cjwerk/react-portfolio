  aboutme:
    "My name is Chris James Werkheiser, I was born in Las Vegas Nevada in the year 2000. When I was 4 my family moved to AZ and I have lived her ever since. When I was 9 years old I didn't know it then but I would meet the women who would become my wife, and on June 5th 2019 she did. I have always loved computer's and would often wonder how they would work, I only started learning how to code in 2020 but I am loving every minute of it. Few things intrigue me as much as learning to code. I am excited to continue to learn more and more about this exciting field, thanks to the wonderfull instructional staff at University of Arizona.",
